#### What is Go?

Go (traditional Chinese: 圍棋; simplified Chinese: 围棋;  Japanese: 囲碁; rōmaji: igo[nb 2]; Korean: 바둑; literally: "encircling game") is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.   (*Wikipedia*)

In this game, each player tries to use threats of death, capture , or isolation to assert control over more of the board than his opponent. 

An abstract strategy game at heart, Go has nonetheless been interpreted as a stylized representation of fighting a war, settling a frontier, cornering a market, thrashing out an argument, or even of fortune-telling and prophecy. 

Go has always been one of the most played games in the world. Top level international competitions can make the best players millionaires.﻿
